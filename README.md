A minimal web application that allows you to download LINE Store stickers and emojis for free.

## About

This website was created to address the shortcoming that the official LINE Store page does not provide a method for downloading products. It also aims to make products available on platforms other than LINE.

## Setup

To insert ads, you need to modify the environment variables. For details, refer to [build.js](/build.js).

## Disclaimer

This project has no affiliation with LY Corporation (ja: LINE ヤフー株式会社) and was created solely for private use, educational, and research purposes.
